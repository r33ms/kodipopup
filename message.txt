Exodus, the addon used for Movies and TV Shows, has been in a slight 
rut lately.  You may have experienced an unusual amount of buffering
or issues finding shows lately.  Exodus has been updated in 1.8.0 to
perform better, but please be aware, it may not work as well as it 
once did, for now atleast.  The developers of the addon are working
toward improving it further.

You will notice a new section under this menu called Cookbook.  This
is a collection of media related to cooking tutorials from some of 
the most popular chef's in the world.  The fitness section has also
been redone and now has more workouts than ever.
